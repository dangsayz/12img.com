# 12img Quality Doctrine

> **This is the baseline standard for all engineering and design work. Apply automatically to every task.**

---

## Design

- **Mobile-first**: generous touch targets, thumb-friendly layouts, frictionless inputs
- **Refined micro-interactions**: app-like responsiveness, polished visual hierarchy
- **Smooth scroll/motion animations**: performance-safe, subtle 3D depth where appropriate
- **Vector-only icons**: Lucide (primary), Heroicons (fallback) — no raster assets

---

## Engineering

- **Audit for edge cases, failure modes, logic gaps** — fix root causes, not symptoms
- **Push performance/reliability to practical limits** with advanced techniques
- **Non-standard optimizations welcome** if they produce measurable, real-world gains
- **Handle all states gracefully**: loading, empty, error, success

---

## Process

- **Document key decisions, tradeoffs, and edge cases inline** so future work builds without re-discovery
- **WCAG 2.1 AA minimum** for accessibility where applicable
- **Regression coverage** for critical paths

## Quick Reference

```
State-of-the-art. Mobile-first. Vector icons (Lucide).
