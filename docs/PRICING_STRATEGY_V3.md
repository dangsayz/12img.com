## 2. Pricing Psychology Principles

### Anchoring Effect
Show the highest tier first (or prominently) to make mid-tiers feel like a deal.

### Decoy Effect
The "Pro" tier should be the obvious best value, making Studio/Elite feel premium.

### Charm Pricing
$19 feels significantly cheaper than $20. $29 feels cheaper than $30.

### Loss Aversion
"7-day expiry" on free tier creates urgency. "Galleries expire" is a pain point.

### Social Proof
"Most Popular" badge on Pro tier guides decision-making.

### Value Framing
Don't sell storage — sell "never worry about running out of space."

3. **Pro:** The "no-brainer" tier — best value, most features ($19/mo, 100GB)
4. **Studio:** For serious professionals ($34/mo, 500GB)
5. **Elite:** Unlimited everything, premium positioning ($54/mo, 2TB)

### New Pricing Table
